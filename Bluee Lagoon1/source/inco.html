                  <h4>EXW (EX WORKS)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Ex works" means that the seller delivers when he places the
                    goods at the disposal of the buyer at the seller's premises
                    or another named place (i.e. works, factory, warehouse,
                    etc.) not cleared for export and not loaded on any
                    collecting vehicle. This term thus represents the minimum
                    obligation for the seller, and the buyer has to bear all
                    costs and risks involved in taking the goods from the
                    seller's premises. However, if the parties wish the seller
                    to be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure
                    and to bear the risks and all the costs of such loading,
                    this should be made clear by adding explicit working to this
                    effect in the contract of sale.
                    <br /><br />This term should not be used when the buyer
                    cannot carry out the export formalities directly or
                    indirectly. In such circumstances, the FCA term should be
                    used, provided the seller agrees that he will load at his
                    cost and risk.
                  </p>

                  <h4>FCA (FREE CARRIER)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Free Carrier" means that the seller delivers the goods,
                    cleared for export, to the carrier nominated by the buyer at
                    the named place. It should be noted that the chosen place of
                    delivery has an impact on the obligations of loading and
                    unloading the goods at that place. If delivery occurs at the
                    seller's premises, the seller is responsible for loading. If
                    delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is not
                    responsible for unloading. This term may be used
                    irrespective of the mode of transport, including multimodal
                    transport.
                    <br /><br />
                    "Carrier" means any person who, in a contract of carriage,
                    undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of
                    transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a
                    combination of such modes. If the buyer nominates a person
                    other than a carrier to receive the goods, the seller is
                    deemed to have fulfilled his obligation to deliver the goods
                    when they are delivered to that person.

                  <h4>FAS (FREE ALONGSIDE SHIP)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Free alongside Ship" means that the seller delivers when
                    the goods are placed alongside the vessel at the named port
                    of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs
                    and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that
                    moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods
                    for export.<br /><br />
                    THIS IS A REVESAL FROM PREVIOUS INCOTERMS VERSIONS WHICH
                    REQURED THE BUYER TO ARRANGE FOR EXPORT CLEARANCE. However,
                    if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export,
                    this should be made clear by adding explicit working to this
                    effect in the contract of sale. This term can be used only
                    for sea or inland waterway transport.

                  <p>
                    "Free on Board" means that the seller delivers when the
                    goods pass the ship's rail at the named port of shipment.
                    This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risk of
                    loss of or damage to the goods from that point. The FOB term
                    requires the seller to clear the goods for export.

                    <br /><br />This term can be used only for sea or inland
                    waterway transport. If the parties do not intend to deliver
                    the goods across the ship's rail, the FCA term should be
                    used.

                  <p>
                    "Cost and Freight" means that the seller delivers when the
                    goods pass the ship's rail in the port of shipment. The
                    seller must pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the
                    goods to the named port of destination BUT the risk of loss
                    of or damage to the goods, as well as any additional costs
                    due to events occurring after the time of delivery, are
                    transferred from the seller to the buyer.
                    <br /><br />The CFR term requires the seller to clear the
                    goods for export. This term can be used only for sea and
                    inland waterway transport. If the parties do not intend to
                    deliver the goods across the ship's rail, the CPT term
                    should be used.

                  <h4>CIF (COST, INSURANCE AND FREIGHT)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Cost, Insurance and Freight" means that the seller delivers
                    when the goods pass the ship's rail in the port of shipment.
                    The seller must pay the costs and freight necessary to bring
                    the goods to the named port of destination BUT the risk of
                    loss of or damage to the goods, as well as any additional
                    costs due to events occurring after the time of delivery,
                    are transferred from the seller to the buyer. However, in
                    CIF the seller also has to procure marine insurance against
                    the buyer's risk of loss of or damage to the goods during
                    the carriage.
                    <br /><br />
                    Consequently, the seller contracts for the insurance and
                    pays the insurance premium. The buyer should note that under
                    the CIF term the seller is required to obtain insurance only
                    on minimum cover. Should the buyer wish to have the
                    protection of greater cover, he would either need to agree
                    as much expressly with the seller or to make his own extra
                    insurance arrangements. The CIF term requires the seller to
                    clear the goods for export. This term can be used only for
                    sea and inland waterway transport. If the parties do not
                    intend to deliver the goods across the ship's rail, the CIF
                    term should be used.

                  <h4>CPT (CARRIAGE PAID TO)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Carriage paid to..." means that the seller delivers the
                    goods to the carrier nominated by him but the seller must in
                    addition pay the cost of carriage necessary to bring the
                    goods to the named destination. This means that the buyer
                    bears all risks and any other costs occurring after the
                    goods have been so delivered. "Carrier" means any person
                    who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to
                    procure the performance of transport, by rail, road, air,
                    sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes.
                    <br /><br />
                    If subsequent carriers are used for the carriage to the
                    agreed destination, the risk passes when the goods have been
                    delivered to the first carrier. The CPT term requires the
                    seller to clear the goods for export. This term may be used
                    irrespective of the mode of transport including multimodal
                    transport.

                  <h4>CIP (CARRIAGE AND INSURANCE PAID TO)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Carriage and Insurance paid to..." means that the seller
                    delivers the goods to the carrier nominated by him but the
                    seller must in addition pay the cost of carriage necessary
                    to bring the goods to the named destination. This means that
                    the buyer bears all risks and any additional costs occurring
                    after the goods have been so delivered. However, in CIP the
                    seller also has to procure insurance against the buyer's
                    risk of loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage.
                    Consequently, the seller contracts for insurance and pays
                    the insurance premium. The buyer should note that under the
                    CIP term the seller is required to obtain insurance only on
                    minimum cover. Should the buyer wish to have the protection
                    of greater cover, he would either need to agree as much
                    expressly with the seller or to make his own extra insurance
                    arrangements.
                    <br /><br />"Carrier" means any person who, in a contract of
                    carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the
                    performance of transport, by rail, road, air, sea, inland
                    waterway or by a combination of such modes. If subsequent
                    carriers are used for the carriage to the agreed
                    destination, the risk passes when the goods have been
                    delivered to the first carrier. The CIP term requires the
                    seller to clear the goods for export. This term may be used
                    irrespective of the mode of transport including multimodal
                    transport.

                  <h4>DAF (DELIVERED AT FRONTIER)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Delivered at Frontier" means that the seller delivers when
                    the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the
                    arriving means of transport not unloaded, cleared for
                    export, but not cleared for import at the named point and
                    place at the frontier, but before the customs border of the
                    adjoining country. The term "frontier" may be used for any
                    frontier including that of the country of export. Therefore,
                    it is of vital importance that the frontier in question be
                    defined precisely by always naming the point and place in
                    the term.
                    <br /><br />However, if the parties wish the seller to be
                    responsible for the unloading of the goods from the arriving
                    means of transport and to bear the risks and costs of
                    unloading, this should be made clear by adding explicit
                    wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term
                    may be used irrespective of the mode of transport when goods
                    are to be delivered at a land frontier. When delivery is to
                    take place in the port of destination, on board a vessel or
                    on the quay (wharf), the DES or DEQ terms should be used.

                  <h4>DES (DELIVERED EX SHIP)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Delivered Ex Ship" means that the seller delivers when the
                    goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on board the
                    ship not cleared for import at the named port of
                    destination. The seller has to bear all the costs and risks
                    involved in bringing the goods to the named port of
                    destination before discharging.
                    <br /><br />If the parties wish the seller to bear the costs
                    and risks of discharging the goods, then the DEQ term should
                    be used. This term can be used only when the goods are to be
                    delivered by sea or inland waterway or multimodal transport
                    on a vessel in the port of destination.

                  <h4>DEQ (DELIVERED EX QUAY)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Delivered Ex Quay" means that the seller delivers when the
                    goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer not cleared
                    for import on the quay (wharf) at the named port of
                    destination. The seller has to bear costs and risks involved
                    in bringing the goods to the named port of destination and
                    discharging the goods on the quay (wharf). The DEQ term
                    requires the buyer to clear the goods for import and to pay
                    for all formalities, duties, taxes and other charges upon
                    import. THIS IS A REVERSAL FROM PREVIOUS INCOTERMS VERSIONS
                    WHICH REQUIRED THE SELLER TO ARRANGE FOR IMPORT CLEARANCE.

                    <br /><br />
                    If the parties wish to include in the seller's obligations
                    all or part of the cost’s payable upon import of the goods,
                    this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this
                    effect in the contract of sale. This term can be used only
                    when the goods are to be delivered by sea or inland waterway
                    or multimodal transport on discharging from a vessel onto
                    the quay (wharf) in the port of destination. However, if the
                    parties wish to include in the seller's obligations, the
                    risks and costs of the handling of the goods from the quay
                    to another place (warehouse, terminal, transport station,
                    etc.) in or outside the port, the DDU or DDP terms should be
                    used.

                  <h4>DDU (DELIVERED DUTY UNPAID)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Delivered duty unpaid" means that the seller delivers the
                    goods to the buyer, not cleared for import, and not
                    unloading from any arriving means of transport at the named
                    place of destination. The seller has to bear the costs and
                    risks involved in bringing the goods thereto, other than,
                    where applicable, any "duty" (which term includes the
                    responsibility for and the risks of the carrying out of
                    customs formalities, and the payment of formalities, customs
                    duties, taxes and other charges) for import in the country
                    of destination. Such "duty has to be borne by the buyer as
                    well as any costs and risks caused by his failure to clear
                    the goods for import in time.
                    <br /><br />
                    However, if the parties wish the seller to carry out customs
                    formalities and bear the costs and risks resulting therefrom
                    as well as some of the costs payable upon import of the
                    goods, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording
                    to this effect in the contract of sale. This term may be
                    used irrespective of the mode of transport but when delivery
                    is to take place in the port of destination on board the
                    vessel or on the quay (wharf), the DES or DEQ terms should
                    be used.

                  <h4>DDP (DELIVERED DUTY PAID)</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Delivered duty paid" means that the seller delivers the
                    goods to the buyer, cleared for import, and not unloaded
                    from any arriving means of transport at the named place of
                    destination. The seller has to bear all the costs and risks
                    involved in bringing the goods thereto including, where
                    applicable, any "duty" (which term includes the
                    responsibility for and the risks of the carrying out of
                    customs formalities and the payment of formalities, customs
                    duties, taxes and other charges) for import in the country
                    of destination. Whilst the EXW term represents the minimum
                    obligation for the seller, DDP represents the maximum
                    obligation.
                    <br /><br />This term should not be used if the seller is
                    unable directly or indirectly to obtain the import license.
                    However, if the parties wish to exclude from the seller's
                    obligations some of the cost’s payable upon import of the
                    goods (such as value-added tax: VAT), this should be made
                    clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the
                    contract of sale. If the parties wish the buyer to bear all
                    risks and costs of the import, the DDU term should be used.
                    This term may be used irrespective of the mode of transport
                    but when delivery is to take place in the port of
                    destination on board the vessel or on the quay (wharf), the
                    DES or DEQ terms should be used.
